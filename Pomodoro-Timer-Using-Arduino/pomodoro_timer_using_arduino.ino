/* Pomodoro Timer using Arduino
 * ---------------------------
 *
 * There are 3 modes of operation  
 * 1.Work mode(duration of 25 minutes)
 * 2.Short Break mode(duration of 5 minutes)
 * 3.Long break mode(duration of 20 minutes)
 * There are 4 LEDs to represent number of pomodoros completed (one pomodoro = 1 complete work mode)
 * There are 3 LEDs to represent mode(work mode (or) short break mode (or) long break mode)
 * after 4 pomodoro there will be a long break
 * one push button for start the pomodoro or to restart(after long break mode)  
 * Buzzer for indicating start and end of short break mode and long break mode 
 * As each mode works based on delay function  use inbuilt reset button on arduino  to restart the pomodoro(if required) 
 *
 *  The circuit:
  - pushbutton is attached to pin 2,push button's other leg is connected to ground. 
  - 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from +5v(externally pulled up)
  - buzzer is connected to pin 3 
  - workPeriodLED is connected to pin 4 
  - shortBreakLED is connected to pin 5 
  - longBreakLED is connected to pin 6 
  - pom1LED is connected to pin 7 
  - pom2LED is connected to pin 8 
  - pom3LED is connected to pin 9 
  - pom4LED is connected to pin 10

This file is created to give some extra functions that you can add to this project

// you can print ASCII values by the following code

 Keyboard.write(corresponding ASCII value); 
 
 for example to print "a" you need to add the following code
 
  Keyboard.write(97);     //ASCII value of "a" is 97 
  
  Keyboard.write(32);      // ASCII value of space bar is 32

  Keyboard Modifiers
The Keyboard.write() and Keyboard.press() and Keyboard.release() commands don’t work with every possible ASCII character, only those that correspond to a key on the keyboard. For example, backspace works, but many of the other non-printable characters produce unpredictable results. For capital letters (and other keys), what’s sent is shift plus the character (i.e. the equivalent of pressing both of those keys on the keyboard).

A modifier key is a special key on a computer keyboard that modifies the normal action of another key when the two are pressed in combination.
